                I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Bermuda. I
                earned my undergraduate degree in Psychology from Clark Atlanta
                University, and later my Master’s degree in Social Work from the
                University of Michigan. My studies were concentrated in
                interpersonal practice with children and families. As a graduate
                student, I was awarded a Public Child Welfare Fellowship where I
                received clinical training in the forensic interviewing of
                children in sexual abuse cases, cultural competence in child
                welfare, and courtroom skills necessary in child maltreatment
                cases.
              </p>

              <p>
                Following graduate school, I worked as a family therapist for
                Catholic Charities in Chicago. Here I gained valuable experience
                providing home-based counseling to children and families in
                foster care. I later relocated to Atlanta where I worked as a
                contractor for Oasis Counseling providing home-based counseling
                for parents involved with the child welfare system. Both
                experiences helped me to understand the value of home visits for
                assessment and case planning in child welfare, and the
                importance of meeting families where they are. I later joined
                the Fulton County Department of Family & Children Services as a
                Child Protective Services Investigator where I worked on the
                front lines to ensure the safety and well-being of children in
                homes where there may be abuse or neglect.

                My greatest joy has been working in my current capacity as a
                school social worker. School is a major source of stress for
                youth, and it is here that I have an opportunity to build
                meaningful relationships with students. I work to inspire and
                support students individually, in groups, workshops, and through
                mindfulness practices. I truly believe that a healthy mind can
                play a part not only in quality of life improvements but also in
                a person’s prognosis. In 2013, I started the first school-based
                mental health program in Fulton County Schools. The partnership
                between Tri-Cities High School and Odyssey Family Counseling
                allowed us to address student mental health needs in a
                comprehensive way to support positive behavioral changes.
                Eliminating student barriers to access mental health services
                was a critical need that I worked to address to improve outcomes
                for children in school.

                In 2015, after a trip to Bali, I developed an interest in
                meditation and mindfulness. With its beautiful views, tranquil
                surroundings, and rich spiritual heritage, I fell in love with
                the island. The Balinese people have a gentle and kind way of
                being. I remember how peaceful I felt on the trip. When I
                returned home, there was a busyness of life that was distinctly
                different. It did not afford the opportunity to be still and
                quiet the mind. Over the years, I have learned that this
                busyness forces our brains into a different way of behaving.
                Practicing mindfulness has been transformative in my personal
                and professional life….
